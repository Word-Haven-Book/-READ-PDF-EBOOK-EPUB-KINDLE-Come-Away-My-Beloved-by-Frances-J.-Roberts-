Title: DiscerningTheKingsHeart
Date: Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2016
Review: Even after 40 years with this devotion in tow, the messages are more TODAY than yesterday, and equally embellishing to the heart as the Masters own hand. It is deeply loving, revealing, comforting, strengthening, exposing and confronting in an atmosphere of Amazing Grace.I need to add some reviewers are referring to her as a make. FRANCIS J. ROBERTS WAS A FEMALE. ( Please Google to verify)

Title: BetterinPrinttoME
Date: Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2016
Review: It's MUCH better in paperback format. For me anyway. This is the only book in my entire life I pray first, asking Holy Spirit what He wants me to know, and then turn to whatever page, knowing which side to read. I can't do that with it on my phone. But in paperback? This rates higher than Streams in the Desert, than anything other than the Bible, TO ME.

Title: VeryEncouraging
Date: Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2020
Review: This book is wonderful if you are looking for a sincere gift, or just little nuggets of encouragement and growth for everyday life. I have purchased several copies of this book to give away over the years for weddings, funerals, and baby showers. It has helped me in my Christian walk for over 15 years.
